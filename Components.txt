What is a Component?
    React is all about "Components"
    Reusable building blocks
    You build these individual Components and then you tell React
    how to compose them together into a final user interface

Why Components?
    Reusability
    Don't repeat yourself
    Separation of concerns
    Don't do too many things in one and the same place(function)

How is a Component Built?
    HTML, CSS, JS = React


React uses Declarative Approach
